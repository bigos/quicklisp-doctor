* Quicklisp Doctor

I need the possibility to have a program that examines the quicklisp installation.

** Project goals
The following goals have been implemented to some extent.

+ Information about new quicklisp release
+ List of local-projects
+ Git version of local-projects
+ SBCL specific
+ Works on Windows too

We may need to improve the code some more. The enxt step would be a list of
requirements that could be used to make sure we have the correct commits in
local-projects.

Windows version works with Msys2 installed and may not work in all situations.
That may require more work. If you have any suggestions please raise an issue.
