* Quicklisp Doctor

I need the possibility to have a program that examines your quicklisp.

** Nice to have

+ Information about new quicklisp release
+ Checking if we have all expected local-projects
+ Version check of local-projects
+ SBCL specific
+ Works on Windows

** No code yet
Write me please.

** git

This is example of checking if the folder has the revision we expect.

#+begin_example
git show --oneline --stat ff2a
git log -1
#+end_example
